I did a group project with my partner in school where we had to use microservices to help each other complete the project. My part of the project was to build a job search program that has a UI that asks the user what job title they're searching for and what city they're in. The program would take that information and send it to the server. The services uses an API that tracks job openings. The server collects the information that was sent from the client and sends the results back to the client. The client takes that JSON file and turns it into a text file and also displays it on the UI. Below is a video link that recorded me walking through the process of the program running.
