I made a client-server project where the client would ask the server for a list of job openings from a certain user input keyword. The server would use an API which
I got from RapidAPI. Their keys have a limited time use so I'd have to get them renewed or a new one. The server would send the opening information back to the client and 
it will be stored in a text file on the client side.
